            carried out activities that have contributed to the well being of her community.The reasons she deserves to
            win this award category are as follows: on February 17, 2018 we offered free tickets to the Chicago Auto
            Show to all children and to their respective families. The members were there to assist them all day</p>
        <p>
            We work in partnership with several African associations such as those of Mali, Ghana, Nigeria, Zimbabwe,
            Mali, Senegal and Liberia but also with non-governmental organizations such as Rainbow Push Coalition, the
            African Chamber of Commerce in Chicago, United African organization etc.</p>
        <p>
            Some partner organizations and associations have requested the assistance of the GCAII and we have spared no
            effort to support them: For the association of Senegalese women in Chicago we help them in planning and
            organizing their dinner for their birthday party. independence and we did all the steps so that they could
            hoist their national flag for the first time in the heart of the city of Chicago

            as a continent of shit.

            First African association to hoist its national flag in downtown Chicago. This event had caused a lot of ink
            to flow in the media in Guinea. With the help of our lawyers, we released young undocumented Guineans who
            were arrested by the American Immigration Service (no photos for reasons of confidentiality ) We attended a
            sister who was abused by her white husband. Today she lives with her daughter and takes care of her
            occupations.
